APRIL 27 - Simple Test and Modular Patterns

Prompt:

This assignment will have you create a simple Javascript object that will be exported using the
Node modular pattern we went over in class

Your object should have a function named 'greet' that takes a name as a parameter and returns
the string 'hello ' + name 

You should have at least one test that verifies the output of the function.
